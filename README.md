# A Friendly Intro to Working with Your Bitbucket via SSH on Windows

  In this tutorial I will show you a quick way to setup your environment to be SSH-ready.

## What is SSH?

  [Wikpedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) says:
  
  *Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network*
  
  It's a fancy way of saying that you can safely send your data from one place to another. 
  
  In our case you'll send the data (your code) from your machine to your repository or vice versa :)
  
## Why to even bother?

  SSH lets you synchronize your local code with your repository in a convenient and quick way. You won't need to drag and drop files, click confirmations and do other tedious stuff anymore. 

## Install Git Bash

  Git Bash is a **command line tool**. Basically, a window, where you can put your commands.
  
  To instal `git` click (here)[https://git-scm.com/downloads]
  
  Tell the installator that you **want to add git to the context menu** - it will give you very convenient options later!
  
## Generate your ssh key

  You can think about SSH key as your identifier - it let's Bitbucket (or GitHub or any other software that uses SSH) identify you.
  
  To generate your first ever SSH key you need to follow two simple steps:
  
  * ### Open your new friend - Git Bash
    * In any folder (might be just your desktop) click your right mouse button
    * Select `Git Bash Here`
    
  * ### Go to https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html
    * Find **Set up SSH for Git on Windows**
    * Follow the steps there (you can ommit **Step 2** if you feel so - it will work)
    
## Clone your repository

  * Go to your Bitbucket (or GitHub or so...) repository and click `Clone`
  
  * Choose `SSH` option in clone window
  
  * Copy the content of sub-window 
  
  * Paste it into Git Bash 
    
    **HARD PART ALERT :)**: in Git Bash use you don't use `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V` instead use:
    
      * `Insert` to paste (and copy) (I know, I know, but it works 🤔)
    
    **NOTE**: check if what you just copied starts with words `git clone`. If yes just press `Enter`. If no add `git clone` in front of what you just copied and press `Enter`.
    
    You should see something similar to the output below on your screen:
    
    ```bash
    $ Cloning into 'PyTorchExercises'...
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    bash: Cloning: command not found
    remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.

    ```
    
## Using git 

  There are three super-basic git commands:
